Mode Value      Number of Crashes
---------------------------------
10               103k                  
100              7670    
200              3957    
500              2178
1000             1034
 
We can see that the total number of crashes drops significantly as we increase the
mod_base value. This could be explained by looking at the property of mods. As the
mod_base value is made smaller and smaller, values being mod'ed by the mod_base will
map to increasingly fewer values. This means there is higher chance of the return value
from f being equal to ref_val since ref_val is also related to mod_base.
 
As a result, we see more values pass through the if statement and cause the program to crash.
